Navigating complex and adversarial networks to achieve mission objectives can be challenging. The current landscape lacks tools for effectively responding to rapid changes in a network's environmental state, especially in hostile conditions. The Tabletop Tool addresses this by proposing an operational model focused on minimizing maneuver costs for successful mission completion.

Operational Model Highlights:

Dynamic System: Represents a computer network with multiple hosts and communication links.
State Space: Reflects the network's health status through individual hosts and network traffic.
Control Actions: Includes measures to protect and maintain the network.
System Dynamics: Describes how the network's state evolves over discrete time steps.
Cost Function: Considers the costs associated with maintaining the network and handling adversarial actions.
Mission Objective:

Objective: Ensure the reliability and security of the computer network.
Optimal Policy: Find the best actions to minimize network vulnerabilities and potential attacks.
Adversarial Action:

Adversary: An attacker attempting to compromise network hosts or disrupt operations.
Attack Estimation: Probability of an attack occurring at each time step.
Adversarial Maneuvers: Actions taken by the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities.
Hostile Environment:

Network Threats: Constant presence of various cyber threats.
Vulnerabilities: Hosts may have exploitable vulnerabilities.
Unpredictability: Adversarial actions may be unpredictable, posing challenges to network defense.
Cyber-Operation:

Control Actions: Admin actions to secure the network.
Dynamic Response: Network's response to adversarial actions.
Optimal Policy: Determine the best actions to minimize vulnerabilities.
Minimal Maneuver Cost:

Cost Assignments: Assigning costs to control actions to minimize the overall cost of maintaining network security.
Host Remediation:

Response to Attacks: Take actions to remediate compromised hosts and restore normal operation.
Attack Prevention:

Preventive Measures: Implement measures to prevent attacks.
